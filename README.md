## Business Activities

### What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?
  - In recent years, many businesses have started incorporating chatbots into their 
customer experiences. However, these chatbots have been limited in their ability 
to assist employees. To address this, Microsoft has developed a solution to help 
employees who use Microsoft products become more efficient. This solution 
elevates the concept of chatbots by incorporating natural language and other 
artificial intelligence technologies, and is designed to streamline employees' 
work with the help of an AI assistant.

### Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
> Per companiesmarketcap.com, as of December 2023 Microsoft has a market cap of $2.770 Trillion. 
This makes Microsoft the world's second most valuable company by market
cap according to our data.

### What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
  - Microsoft has a massive subscriber base of over 76.7 million users. [^2]  This 
gives them access to a wealth of data that can be used to further enhance their 
Copilot product, especially for enterprise-level users. Companies that have 
already integrated Windows into their operations are less likely to opt for 
alternative solutions such as Open AI due to the high costs and time-consuming 
process of integrating new software and vendors. This is why Microsoft Teams is 
often the preferred choice over Slack for companies that have large contracts 
with Microsoft.
