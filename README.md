## Business Activities

#### What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?
In recent years, many businesses have started incorporating chatbots into their customer experiences. However, these chatbots have been limited in their ability to confidently assist users. To address this, Microsoft has developed a solution to help Windows and GitHub users become more efficient by leveraging machine learning and natural language processing. Because of this Copilot elevates streamline employees end users by automatically completing tasks, syntesizing and communicating complex information, and even attending meetings and providing notes and take aways for the attendees. 

#### Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

The main target audiences for Microsoft Copilots will be its retail and enterprise Windows users, and developers for its GitHub Copilot offerings. 

> Per companiesmarketcap.com, as of December 2023 Microsoft has a market cap of $2.770 Trillion. 
This makes Microsoft the world's second most valuable company by market
cap according to our data.

#### What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
Microsoft has a massive subscriber base of over 76.7 million users. [^2]  This gives them access to a wealth of data that can be used to further enhance their Copilot product, especially for enterprise-level users. Companies that have already integrated Windows into their operations are less likely to opt for alternative solutions such as [Open AI](https://openai.com/) due to the high costs and time-consuming process of integrating new software and vendors. This is why Microsoft Teams is often the preferred choice over Slack for companies that have large contracts 
with Microsoft.

#### Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? 
> Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 is an AI-powered productivity tool that coordinates large language models (LLMs), content in Microsoft Graph, and the Microsoft 365 apps that you use every day, such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Teams, and others. This integration provides real-time intelligent assistance, enabling users to enhance their creativity, productivity, and skills.
Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 uses a combination of LLMs, a type of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm that uses deep learning techniques and vast data sets to understand, summarize, predict, and generate content. These LLMs include pre-trained models, such as Generative Pre-Trained Transformers (GPT) like GPT-4, designed to excel in these tasks.[^3]

Additionally, Copilot leverages [OpenAI Codex](https://openai.com/blog/openai-codex) technology that is mostly used for GitHub and most friendly with Pythong but is also proffiecent with JavaScript, Go, Perl, PHP, Ruby, Swift and TypeScript.

#### What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5&ndash;10 years?

AI has come a long way over the last decade, specifically assistance or better known as Chatbots. Machine learning and natural language processing has gone from completely dependent on human intervention to being almost entirely autonomous.

To no surprise, chat-GPT has been all of the rage in 2023, and rightfully so. The technology behind chat-GPT has unlocked the potential for computers to sound more human in their responses,  complete complex tasks, synthesize and explain large data sets in the simplistic ways, and no longer completely dependent on humans to update responses. GPTs learn on their own with the data that is available wether it be the entire internet or for an enterprise such as Microsoft. 

This has major ramifications for Microsoft because not only does this technology impact its window’s user but also the GitHub user base which impact over 100 millions users worldwide. Not only will Window’s users be able to delegate manual tasks to their AI assistance but developers world wide who have copilot of their own that help streamline their development. [^1]

  - Apple

## Results

#### What has been the business impact of this company so far?
Over the last four decades, Microsoft has revolutionized the Productivity space with the introduction of windows and other products. They have engrained themselves in many corporations that depend on them for their word processing, data analysis, and presentation software.  Revenue in 2024 1Q for the productivity and business segment
just saw over $18.6 billion, and the cloud services segment and the Intelligent Cloud segment had $24.3 billion. [2]

#### What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics?

There are a couple metrics that Microsoft will be looking at, increase in revenue and it's active user count for their copilot products in Window's and GitHub. Because these new features became available in late 2023 there is no published data on success metrics at this time. 

#### How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?
At an AI assistant level it is unknown at this time. Microsoft recently rolled out the Copilot product and user adoption is currently unknown. 

## Recommendations

#### If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer?

As of right now Copilot is limited to just Windows and Github. One product I would recommend is creating a subscription browser based copilot that can take a multiple website such as yahoo finance and a company’s investor relations site to easily synthesize the most important pieces of a company profile and financial outlook. 

The outputs could include a high level summary of the company and it’s financial and innovation outlook for the next 1-5 years based, relevant charts and graphs, list its potential competitors in each space they are conducting business in, and what the overall sentiment is for the company.

#### Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

This product would help benefit the company because the majority of professionals, and students are familiar with windows products. Instead of looking for alternatives such as Chat-GPT, or other companies to synthesize this data with tools that are unfamiliar Microsoft could easily leverage their word processing, data, and presentation products to create the outputs in a visual manner that a vast majority of already have experience with. 

Additionally, working in the professional field I am required to do competitive analysis, and company research for potential clients and this would be something that I would find extremely helpful and my company would pay an enterprise license for without even blinking.

#### What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
 - Existing Windows suite (Word, Excel, Powerpoint, Teams)
 - GPT
 - Azure
 - [OpenAI Codex](https://openai.com/blog/openai-codex)
 - Machine Learning
 - Natural Language Processing/LLMs
 - Java, Python, HTML, CSS, .Net

#### Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

These technologies are existing technologies being utilized by Microsoft and would make logical sense in order to get to market quickly and to scale.
