## Business Activities

#### What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?
In recent years, many businesses have started incorporating chatbots into their 
customer experiences. However, these chatbots have been limited in their ability 
to assist employees. To address this, Microsoft has developed a solution to help 
employees who use Microsoft products become more efficient. This solution 
elevates the concept of chatbots by incorporating natural language and other 
artificial intelligence technologies, and is designed to streamline employees' 
work with the help of an AI assistant.

#### Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

The main target audiences for Microsoft Copilots will be its retail and enterprise Windows users, and developers for its GitHub Copilot offerings. 

> Per companiesmarketcap.com, as of December 2023 Microsoft has a market cap of $2.770 Trillion. 
This makes Microsoft the world's second most valuable company by market
cap according to our data.

#### What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
Microsoft has a massive subscriber base of over 76.7 million users. [^2]  This 
gives them access to a wealth of data that can be used to further enhance their 
Copilot product, especially for enterprise-level users. Companies that have 
already integrated Windows into their operations are less likely to opt for 
alternative solutions such as Open AI due to the high costs and time-consuming 
process of integrating new software and vendors. This is why Microsoft Teams is 
often the preferred choice over Slack for companies that have large contracts 
with Microsoft.

#### What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5&ndash;10 years?

AI has come a long way over the last decade, specifically assistance or better known as Chatbots. Machine learning and natural language processing has gone from completely dependent on human intervention to being almost entirely autonomous.

To no surprise, chat-GPT has been all of the rage in 2023, and rightfully so. The technology behind chat-GPT has unlocked the potential for computers to sound more human in their responses,  complete complex tasks, synthesize and explain large data sets in the simplistic ways, and no longer completely dependent on humans to update responses. GPTs learn on their own with the data that is available wether it be the entire internet or for an enterprise such as Microsoft. 

This has major ramifications for Microsoft because not only does this technology impact its window’s user but also the GitHub user base which impact over 100 millions users worldwide. Not only will Window’s users be able to delegate manual tasks to their AI assistance but developers world wide who have copilot of their own that help streamline their development. [^1]

#### What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics?

There are a couple metrics that Microsoft will be looking at, increase in revenue and it's active user count for their copilot products in Window's and GitHub. Because these new features became available in late 2023 there is no published data on success metrics at this time. 

#### How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?
At an AI assistant level it is unknown at this time. Microsoft recently rolled out the Copilot product and user adoption is currently unknown.
